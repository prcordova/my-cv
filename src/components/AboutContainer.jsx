      <p>
        As a dedicated Frontend Developer with several years of experience, I
        have honed my expertise in a variety of technologies, including React,
        SCSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and more. My previous roles at companies such
        as Betalabs, Paipe, FireDev, and GOL Airlines have provided me with
        valuable exposure to diverse projects and environments, allowing me to
        develop strong problem-solving abilities and collaborative skills.
